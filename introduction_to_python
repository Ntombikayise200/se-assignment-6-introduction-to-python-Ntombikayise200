1.Python Basics:
Python is a high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity, with features like dynamic typing, extensive standard library, and support for multiple programming paradigms. 
It's widely used in web development (Django), data analysis (Pandas), and automation (scripting).

2.Installing Python:
To install Python, download the installer from python.org, run it, and ensure to add Python to PATH during installation on Windows; on macOS and Linux, use the built-in package manager.
Verify by running python --version and set up a virtual environment with python -m venv <venv_name>

3.print("Hello, World!")
4.Data Types and Variables:
Includes integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Example: num = 10, name = "Alice".

5.Control Structures:
Conditional if-else statements and for loops handle decisions and iterations, respectively.

6.Functions in Python:
Defined with def, functions are reusable blocks of code; example: def add_numbers(a, b): return a + b.

7.Lists and Dictionaries:
Lists hold ordered collections, dictionaries store key-value pairs; example: numbers = [1, 2, 3], person = {"name": "Alice"}.

8.Exception Handling:
Manages errors with try, except, and optionally finally blocks; example: try: result = 10 / 0 except ZeroDivisionError as e: print("Error:", e).

9.Modules and Packages:
Modules contain functions and variables; packages are directories of modules. Import and use like import math; example: math.sqrt(16).

10.File I/O:
Read from a file with open('example.txt', 'r'), write with open('fruits.txt', 'w'); manage content using read() and write().
